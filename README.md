# Afterflow

A private, offline-first iOS app for logging psychedelic-assisted therapy sessions

## Overview

Afterflow is a therapeutic session logging app designed for individuals undergoing psychedelic-assisted therapy. It provides a safe, private space to record intentions, environment details, music, mood changes, and post-session reflections—all while maintaining complete privacy and working entirely offline.

### Key Features

- **🔒 Privacy-First**: All data stays on your device. No cloud sync, tracking, or external data collection
- **📱 Native iOS**: Built with SwiftUI and SwiftData for optimal performance on iPhone and iPad
- **🌐 Offline-First**: Core functionality works without internet connection
- **🎵 Spotify Integration**: Optional playlist linking (planned) for music context
- **📊 Mood Tracking**: Before and after session mood ratings with visual feedback
- **📝 Comprehensive Logging**: Capture treatment type, dosage, environment, intentions, and reflections
- **♿ Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and Dynamic Type compliance

### Therapeutic Value

Afterflow helps users:
- Track therapeutic progress over time
- Reflect on session experiences and insights
- Maintain detailed records for clinical discussions
- Understand patterns in mood and treatment response
- Export data for sharing with healthcare providers (planned)

   - Choose your preferred simulator or connected device
   - Minimum deployment target: iOS 17.6

3. **Build the Project:**
   - Press `Cmd + B` to build
   - Or use Product → Build from menu

### Running the App

1. **In Simulator:**
   - Press `Cmd + R` to build and run
   - App will launch in iOS Simulator

2. **On Physical Device:**
   - Connect your iOS device via USB
   - Select your device from the scheme selector
   - Press `Cmd + R` to install and launch

### Development Signing

The app is configured for automatic code signing. If you encounter signing issues:

1. Select the Afterflow project in Xcode navigator
2. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
3. Change the "Team" to your Apple Developer account
4. Update "Bundle Identifier" to a unique identifier

## Testing

Afterflow maintains high test coverage with comprehensive unit and UI tests.

### Running Tests

**All Tests:**
```bash
# Command line
xcodebuild test -scheme Afterflow -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'

# Or in Xcode: Cmd + U
```

**Specific Test Suites:**
```bash
# Model tests only
xcodebuild test -scheme Afterflow -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' -only-testing:AfterflowTests/TherapeuticSessionTests

# Service tests only  
xcodebuild test -scheme Afterflow -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' -only-testing:AfterflowTests/SessionDataServiceTests
```

### Test Coverage

Current test coverage includes:
- **Model Tests**: TherapeuticSession entity validation, computed properties, data management
- **Service Tests**: CRUD operations, auto-save, draft recovery, validation
- **UI Tests**: App launch, basic navigation
- **Performance Tests**: Large dataset handling

**Coverage Target**: 80% minimum (currently achieved)

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests** (`AfterflowTests/`): Model and service layer testing
- **UI Tests** (`AfterflowUITests/`): User interface workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Data handling and app launch metrics

## Architecture

Afterflow follows a clean architecture pattern optimized for SwiftUI:

- **Models**: SwiftData entities for local persistence
- **Services**: Data access and business logic
- **Views**: SwiftUI user interface components  
- **ViewModels**: Observable state management (iOS 17+)

### Key Principles

1. **Privacy-First**: No external data transmission
2. **SwiftUI + SwiftData Native**: Modern Apple frameworks
3. **Offline-First**: Local-first data storage
4. **Test-Driven**: 80% minimum test coverage
5. **Therapeutic Value**: Every feature supports healing

## Development Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)

## Contributing

This is a personal therapeutic app project. While the code is public for transparency, direct contributions are not currently accepted. However, feedback and suggestions are welcome through Issues.

### Development Setup

1. **Constitutional Compliance**: All changes must align with privacy-first principles
2. **Test-Driven Development**: New features require accompanying tests
3. **Accessibility**: All UI components must support VoiceOver and Dynamic Type

## Privacy & Data

### Data Collection: None
Afterflow collects **zero** personal data. All information stays on your device.

### Data Storage
- **Local Only**: SwiftData with SQLite backing
- **Optional CloudKit**: User-controlled sync (planned)
- **No Analytics**: No usage tracking or crash reporting

### Data Export
- **User Controlled**: Export only when explicitly requested
- **Local Processing**: All export operations happen on-device
- **Secure Sharing**: Uses iOS standard sharing mechanisms
