## Formatting & Linting

SwiftFormat and SwiftLint enforce consistent style across the app and test targets.

1. Install the tools if necessary: `brew install swiftformat swiftlint`
2. **Important:** Recent changes were checked in without running these scripts. Make sure to run them now _and_ before any future commits so CI stays clean:

```bash
./Scripts/run-swiftformat.sh
./Scripts/run-swiftlint.sh
```

Resolve all violations (or document intentional suppressions) so CI stays clean.

## Architecture

Afterflow follows a clean architecture pattern optimized for SwiftUI:

- **Models**: SwiftData entities for local persistence
- **Services**: Data access and business logic
- **Views**: SwiftUI user interface components  
- **ViewModels**: Observable state management (iOS 17+)

### Key Principles

1. **Privacy-First**: No external data transmission
2. **SwiftUI + SwiftData Native**: Modern Apple frameworks
3. **Offline-First**: Local-first data storage
4. **Careful Network Use**: Only oEmbed fetches for supported music providers; no playback, tracking, or analytics
5. **Test-Driven**: 80% minimum test coverage
6. **Therapeutic Value**: Every feature supports healing

## Music Link Support

- **Tier 1 (oEmbed metadata)**: Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, Tidal  
  - Fetches title/author/thumbnail/duration via oEmbed; displays duration (e.g., “1 hr 23 min”) when available.
- **Tier 2 (link-only providers)**: Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Bandcamp, custom  
  - Parses titles from URLs when metadata isn’t available; uses brand logos and fallback thumbnails.
- **Branding**: Provider logos stored in `Assets.xcassets/Brands` with light/dark variants; UI falls back to a music note when unavailable.
- **Privacy**: No playback or authentication; only lightweight metadata fetches for oEmbed-capable providers.

## Development Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
- [x] Core data model (TherapeuticSession)
- [x] Persistence layer (SessionStore + SwiftData)
- [x] Comprehensive test suite
- [x] Basic session list view

### ✅ Phase 2: Session Form UI
- [x] SessionFormView for creating/editing sessions
- [x] Form validation, inline errors, and keyboard navigation
- [x] Date/treatment type pickers with auto-save/draft recovery

### ✅ Phase 3–5: Enhanced UI Components
- [x] Music link preview card + “attach link” flow
- [x] Mood rating sliders with emoji map + accessibility tests
- [x] Session detail view with editable reflections and persistence error handling

### ✅ Phase 6: History List
- [x] SessionListViewModel (sort/filter/search)
- [x] Delete + Undo banner, VoiceOver-friendly filter menu
- [x] Large dataset fixtures + performance tests (<200 ms scroll for 1k sessions)

### 🎵 Phase 7+: Music Links & Data Export
- [x] Playlist link previews (Spotify/YouTube oEmbed, link-only fallback)
- [x] CSV/PDF export flows with filters and offline file export
- [x] Governance and privacy review for exports (on-device only)

## Export Usage
- Open the Sessions list, tap **Export**, choose CSV or PDF, and optionally filter by date range or treatment type.
- Exports run locally and present the iOS file exporter/share sheet; temporary files are cleaned after completion.
- CSVs use RFC‑4180 quoting and injection guards; PDFs include session summaries with optional cover pages.

## CSV Import Guide

Afterflow supports importing session data from CSV files, making it easy to:
- Migrate data from other apps or spreadsheets
- Bulk-add sessions from clinical records
- Restore previously exported data

### CSV Format Requirements

The CSV must be **UTF-8 encoded** with the following header row (exact column names required):

```
Date,Treatment Type,Administration,Intention,Mood Before,Mood After,Reflections,Music Link URL
```

### Column Specifications

| Column | Format | Valid Values | Example |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Date** | Medium date + short time (en_US_POSIX) | `MMM d, yyyy 'at' h:mm a` | `Dec 10, 2024 at 2:30 PM` |
| **Treatment Type** | Text | `Psilocybin`, `LSD`, `DMT`, `MDMA`, `Ketamine`, `Ayahuasca`, `Mescaline`, `Cannabis`, `Other` | `Psilocybin` |
| **Administration** | Text | `Intravenous (IV)`, `Intramuscular (IM)`, `Oral`, `Nasal`, `Other` | `Oral` |
| **Intention** | Text | Any non-empty string | `To explore creativity` |
| **Mood Before** | Integer | 1-10 | `5` |
| **Mood After** | Integer | 1-10 | `8` |
| **Reflections** | Text | Any string (can be empty) | `Felt peaceful and connected` |
| **Music Link URL** | URL | Any valid URL or empty | `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/...` |

### Creating a CSV Template

#### Option 1: Use the Built-in Example
The quickest way to get a valid template:
1. Open Afterflow
2. Tap **Menu → Help → Example Import**
3. Save the example CSV file
4. Open it in your preferred editor and modify as needed

#### Option 2: Export Existing Data
If you already have sessions in Afterflow:
1. Create one or two sample sessions
2. Export them as CSV
3. Use the exported file as your template

#### Option 3: Create Manually
Create a text file with a `.csv` extension and use this template:

```csv
Date,Treatment Type,Administration,Intention,Mood Before,Mood After,Reflections,Music Link URL
Dec 10, 2024 at 2:30 PM,Psilocybin,Oral,To explore creativity and connection,5,8,"Felt peaceful, connected to nature. Insights about relationships.",https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4dyzvuaRJ0n
Dec 3, 2024 at 10:00 AM,Ketamine,Intravenous (IV),Process grief and find acceptance,4,7,Gentle experience. Worked through difficult emotions.,
Nov 15, 2024 at 6:45 PM,MDMA,Oral,Healing trauma with therapist,3,9,"Breakthrough session. Finally felt safe enough to process childhood memories. So grateful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

### Important Notes

1. **Date Format**: Must match exactly `MMM d, yyyy 'at' h:mm a` (e.g., `Dec 10, 2024 at 2:30 PM`)
2. **Quoted Fields**: Fields containing commas, quotes, or newlines must be wrapped in double quotes (`"`)
3. **Escaped Quotes**: Use `""` (two double quotes) to include a quote character within a quoted field
4. **Music Links**:
   - Can be any valid URL (Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, etc.)
   - Leave empty if no music link
   - The app will automatically classify the provider and fetch metadata for supported services
5. **Excel/Google Sheets**: If creating in a spreadsheet app:
   - Format the Date column exactly as shown
   - Save/Export as CSV (UTF-8)
   - Verify the exported file matches the expected format

### CSV Injection Protection

Afterflow automatically protects against CSV injection attacks:
- Fields starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` are prefixed with `'` during export
- When importing, these prefixes are stripped automatically
- You don't need to manually handle this unless creating files outside of Afterflow exports

### Using the Import Feature

1. Prepare your CSV file following the format above
2. Transfer the file to your iOS device (via AirDrop, Files app, email, etc.)
3. Open Afterflow
4. Navigate to Settings → Import Data
5. Select your CSV file
6. Review the import summary
7. Confirm to add the sessions

### Troubleshooting

**"Invalid header" error:**
- Verify the header row exactly matches: `Date,Treatment Type,Administration,Intention,Mood Before,Mood After,Reflections,Music Link URL`
- Check for extra spaces or typos in column names

**"Invalid row" error:**
- Check the date format matches exactly (Medium date + short time)
- Verify Treatment Type and Administration values match the valid options
- Ensure Mood Before/After are integers between 1-10
- Make sure all required fields (Date through Mood After) have values

**"Data is not UTF-8 encoded" error:**
- Re-save your CSV file with UTF-8 encoding
- In Excel: Save As → CSV UTF-8
- In Google Sheets: Download → CSV automatically uses UTF-8
