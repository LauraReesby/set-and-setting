# Tasks: Core Session Logging

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-core-session-logging/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Testing**: Tests are MANDATORY for all features with 80% minimum coverage requirement

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

- [ ] T001 Update project structure per implementation plan in SetAndSetting/
- [ ] T002 Configure SwiftData model container in SetAndSettingApp.swift
- [ ] T003 [P] Create folder structure: Models/, Views/, ViewModels/, Services/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in priority order (P1 stories first)
  - US1 and US2 are both P1 and can be done in parallel after foundation
  - US3 and US4 are P2 and can start after P1 stories
  - US5 is P1 but depends on having sessions to display, so should come after US1-US2

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 session model but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 session model
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 session model
- **User Story 5 (P1)**: Should start after US1/US2 complete to have data to display

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1 + 2**: Setup and Foundation (T001-T009)
2. **User Story 1**: Core session creation (T010-T017)
3. **User Story 2**: Environment and music (T018-T023) - parallel with US1 if desired
4. **User Story 5**: Session history view (T036-T043) - needs US1 data model
5. **User Story 3**: Mood ratings (T024-T029) - enhances existing sessions
6. **User Story 4**: Reflections editing (T030-T035) - enhances existing sessions
7. **Phase 8**: Polish and testing (T044-T051)

### Parallel Opportunities

- T003, T005, T006, T007 can run in parallel during Foundation phase
- T010, T011 can run in parallel during US1
- T018, T019, T023 can run in parallel during US2
- All SwiftUI preview tasks marked [P] can be done in parallel
- Polish tasks T044, T045, T047, T048, T050, T051 can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 5 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL)
3. Complete User Story 1: Core session creation
4. Complete User Story 2: Environment and music details
5. Complete User Story 5: Session history view
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test complete session creation and viewing workflow
7. Deploy/demo if ready - this provides a complete basic session logging app

### Full Feature Set

Continue with User Stories 3 and 4 to add mood ratings and reflection editing, then complete Polish phase for production readiness.

## Notes

- SwiftData models should be designed with future CloudKit sync in mind
- All views should support both iPhone and iPad with adaptive layouts
- Consider using @Observable for ViewModels in iOS 17+
- Implement proper SwiftUI state management to avoid data inconsistencies
- Test with VoiceOver and Dynamic Type for accessibility
- Use SwiftUI previews extensively for rapid iteration
- **CRITICAL**: Maintain 80% code coverage throughout development - check coverage after each task completion
- Write tests FIRST for each user story before implementation (TDD approach)
- All tests must pass before moving to next phase
- Code coverage reports should be generated and reviewed regularly
